# travelapp
This is a simple app to plan the places you want to go when you travel.

The basic idea is that you input a location, a time you want to leave, and which means of transportation you will use to get there.

My goal with this project is to experience how to develop an app with React/Redux. I've followed the steps of the book [Learning React - Functional Web Development with React and Redux from O'Reilly](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920049579.do)

I would deeply appreciate input about how I could organize my files and implement best practices, as well as fix bugs.

Things that are missing:
- Add style.
- Add validation to form fields.
- Add sort by datetime.
- Add localStorage.
- Add service worker so we can use the app while we are travelling and don't have access to internet.

Ideas for features:
- Have notifications when it is getting close to the time to leave.
- Have filters to show only upcoming destinations, and hide/show past destinations.
- Add a 'Comments' field to write how the experience was.
